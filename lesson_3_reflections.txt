When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    A remote repository is needed if you want to share your project with other people
    and/or would like them to collaborate with you.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because GitHub is a public space, your project might be viewed and edited by
    different people at different times. Each new change should be viewed and verified by you
    (as it's your project), but if it's added to your local repository automatically,
    you will lose contol over your own project, which will probably lead to bad
    consequences in the future.
